Sustainable programming through good and clean code

Abstract
The more a software becomes complex, the more important it is to have a well-structured, good, and clean code. This report gives sight to sustainable programming through good and clean code. There are some guidelines under which developers are strongly recommended to keep track when developing or there are methods for sustainable programming. Some of these methods can be, for example, functional programming styles, writing testable code, documenting software, the philosophies or principles when creating software, uses of static code analysis tools to measure the software quality, and some more. This enables future errors to be conveniently fixed and provides understandable procedures for future developers to work on improvements and additional features. There is a saying “a code is written for a future programmer”, and it is true. That is precisely why a good, clean, and well-functional code is truly a key to a successful project.
